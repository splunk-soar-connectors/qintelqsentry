# Qintel QSentry App for Splunk SOAR

## Description

QSentry queries help measure the likelihood that a user is masking their identity using publicly or privately available
proxy or VPN services. The returns also flag any known fraud associations. QSentry aggregates data from Qintelâ€™s
proprietary Deep and DarkWeb research, as well as from commercially available anonymization services.
