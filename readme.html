        <h1>Qintel QSentry App for Splunk SOAR</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            QSentry queries help measure the likelihood that a user is masking their identity using publicly or
            privately available proxy or VPN services. The returns also flag any known fraud associations. QSentry
            aggregates data from Qintel’s proprietary Deep and DarkWeb research, as well as from commercially
            available anonymization services.
